Abstract
--------
> You can do quite a few things with the action sand activities provided by Microsoft using Visual Studio and SharePoint Designer. But can you really expect Microsoft to give you everything you could want to do? They can’t read your mind. In these cases where the provided actions and activities don’t meet your needs, in this session you’ll learn how to do so much more by calling the SharePoint REST API, both using Visual Studio and SharePoint Designer!
